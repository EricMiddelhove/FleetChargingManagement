# FleetChargingManagement
This code was written within the dissertation of Ola Pronobis "Charge management concepts with integrated requirements management in case of unpredictable behavior of electric vehicle fleets" at TU Braunschweig. More information can be found in the published dissertation. The code includes a fleet simulation and an integrated optimization algorithm to dynamically charge a fleet of electric vehicles. Ecological and/or economic goals can be set. The algorithm takes into account the CO2 emissions in the electricity mix, the loads at the site, the driving forecasts, the current electricity prices and the renewable energies generated.
